1	GO	The Gene Ontology (GO) project is a 
collaborative effort to address the need for 
consistent descriptions of gene products in 
different databases. It has developed three 
structured controlled vocabularies (ontologies) 
that describe gene products in terms of their 
associated biological processes, cellular 
components and molecular functions in a 
species-independent manner.	http://www.geneontology.org/
2	InterPro	InterPro is a database of protein families,
domains and functional sites in which 
identifiable features found in known 
proteins can be applied to 
unknown protein sequences.	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/
